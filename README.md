### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ It's Carlos (he/his) here.
## Current activities
I'm currently working on the [livablestreets project](https://github.com/chvieira2/livablestreets). Livablestreets was the conclusion project of the bootcamp in Data Sciences I completed in Jun 2022 at Le Wagon. This is a collaborative work developed in colaboration with [Laia Grobe](https://github.com/Laiagdla), [Ieva Bidermane](https://github.com/ievabi) and [Nicolas Quiroga](https://github.com/nicoquiroga941). Please check it out [here](https://livablestreets.herokuapp.com/)
